### What Your Crasher Does:

- Shows fake error messages to scare the user.
- Kills explorer.exe to close the desktop and taskbar.
- Forces the computer to reboot multiple times (e.g., 5 times).
- Provides GUI buttons for Restart, Sign Out, or “I Don’t Care” (auto reboot).
- Hides itself by setting hidden attributes or removing from startup.
- Can clean up after itself by deleting prank-related files/folders.

### How It Works:

- Uses PowerShell commands like Stop-Process to kill explorer.exe.
- Uses Restart-Computer to force reboot.
- Displays GUI dialogs via Windows Forms.
- Runs at startup to trigger automatically.
- Manipulates folders like "Device-Crasher" to store prank data.

### Important Notes:
# Can also damage justtttttt a bit (not with the system or the Loop 5 reboot can but do it only in a vm)

- It’s a prank script — no real damage done to hardware or system files. (only will open a lot of programs)
- Use responsibly and only on devices you own or have permission to prank.
- Frequent reboots may cause loss of unsaved work.
- To stop the prank, boot into Safe Mode or use another admin account.
